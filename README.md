# A* Demo

An implementation of the A* (A Star) search algorithm that can run in a browser using JavaScript

## Installation
Download repository. Run index.html from local repository in your browser. 

## Directions
Once index.html is open in your browser, click on squares in the blue field to place a start, goal, and obstacles. 
Use the buttons to the right to change the type of square that will be placed.
Click "Run" to run the algorithm.
Refresh page for a new run.


## Development notes

Basic functionality is present. User interface needs more work. Below is a list of features being worked on.

### Direction/messageing text
Implement directions text so users know how to interact with demo. Implement message box to give user feedback, including when no path is found.

### Reset button
Would be nicer than making user refresh page

### Improve square placement interface
Clicking individual boxes to place obstacles is cumbersome. Modify so user can draw obstacles.
